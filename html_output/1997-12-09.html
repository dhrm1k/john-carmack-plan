        <p>BIG BUG IN Q2 NETWORKING!</p>
<p>If you run multiplayer servers, download:</p>
<p>ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2_306.zip</p>
<p>A serious bug got through.. I thought the QuakeWorld master server code was completely disabled, because I was planning on putting a modified architecture in place in the point release. It turns out that the code is still in there, sending heartbeats to a unix machine here at id that isn't even running a master server.</p>
<p>That wouldn't normally be an issue - a packet every five minutes from all the servers.</p>
<p>Except...</p>
<p>Cyrix has a new processor that is significantly faster at single precision floating point calculations if you don't do any double precision calculations anywhere.</p>
<p>Quake had always kept its timebase as a double precision seconds value, but I agreed to change it over to an integer millisecond timer to allow the global setting of single precision mode.</p>
<p>We went through and changed all the uses of it that we found, but the routine that sends heartbeats to the master servers was missed.</p>
<p>So, instead of sending a packet every 300 seconds, it is sending one every 300 MILLISECONDS.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>To a server, it won't really make a difference. A tiny extra packet three times a second is a fraction of the bandwidth of a player.</p>
<p>However, if there are thousands of network games in progress, that is a LOT of packets flooding idsoftware.com.</p>
<p>So, please download the new executable if you are going to run any servers (even servers started through the menus).</p>
<p>ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2_306.zip</p>
<p>This isn't the real point release - there are no new features or bugfixes. I just went back to the release codebase and recompiled with one function commented out so we wouldn't have to worry about introducing new bugs with our current untested code.</p>
<p>Btw, all bug reports should go to Christian (xian@idsoftware.com), NOT to me, Brian, or Cash! We need a central point to funnel things through. Hopefully we can set up a web page or something to make public what we know about, so we can cut down on email traffic.</p>
