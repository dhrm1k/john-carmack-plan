        <p>I apologize for not getting the Mac version released this last time.</p>
<p>All conspiracy theories aside, here is what actually happened:</p>
<p>I had my San Jose travel scheduled a while ago, and we were expecting to have the release done before I left. We didn't quite make it, and nobody else at the office knew how to build the mac version after Cash made some last minute changes.</p>
<p>When I got back, Graeme was taking off to move his family down here. Graeme is in charge of building all the installs for our releases.</p>
<p>I considered just tossing new executables with the latest fixes for everything, but some data has changed, and it just isn't worth the hassle right now.</p>
<p>We will be making proper new releases for all architectures monday night when he gets back.</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed marks fading properly in fog volumes</li>
<li>show weapon in fov &gt;90, adjusting position down as needed</li>
<li>allow run/bob variables to be changed in non-cheat games</li>
<li>update scoreboard info while at intermission</li>
<li>fixed angles on resetplayerentities, corrects twitch on players as you come through a teleporter or respawn</li>
<li>print "waiting to play" for tourney spectators</li>
<li>fixed tied rank with 0 score and spectators</li>
<li>return to roaming spectator when a followed client quits or spectates</li>
<li>release windows cursor when running windowed and the console is down</li>
</ul>
