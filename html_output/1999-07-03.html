        <p>AMD K7 cpus are very fast.</p>
<p>Some timedemo numbers (a new demo, not comparable to previous scores):</p>
<p>Run at 640<em>480</em>16 bit color to emphasise the cpu/driver performance rather than the hardware fill rate.</p>
<p>[code]
                    K7-600  K7-550  PIII-500
TNT2 ultra 16 bit     73.9    68.5      53.8
Voodoo3 3000 16 bit    70.5   65.2      46.0
[/code]</p>
<p>This is with K7 optimized drivers vs seperate PIII optimized drivers.</p>
<p>There is still wiggle room there in that it is possible that more effort was expended to make the AMD drivers perform better. That is perfectly valid from a consumer's point of view, but muddies the technical CPU comparison.</p>
<p>On identical code run on the systems, there was some more interesting data:</p>
<p>On my map processing tools, the K7 was faster than the PIII, but only slightly more so than the reletive clock rate increase. I would guess that this is due to larger data sets that don't fit in cache as well.</p>
<p>On the matrox OpenGL drivers, which have not been optimized very much and (to my knowledge) contain no PIII specific code, the K7 was a LOT faster.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I feel comfortable standing behind the statement that the K7 is faster than the PIII. I will have to wait for some stuff to come out of NDA to provide a more detailed technical analysis.</p>
<p>Architectural cleverness is all well and good, but if AMD can't keep the clock speed up with intel, they will still fall behind. A 700 mhz PIII would probably find a lot of applications (especially integer apps) where it would outperform a 600 mhz K7.</p>
