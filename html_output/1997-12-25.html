        <p>We are going to release a new quake 2 executable that fixes the malicious server crashing problems Real Soon Now. It also fixes a ton of other problems that have been reported, so we are going to have to give it some good testing before releasing it.</p>
<p>John Cash has two kids that would lynch him if he came in and worked on christmas, so we certainly won't be able to get a release candidate together before the weekend. I am fairly confidant we will have it released to the public on sunday.</p>
<p>I have been spending most of my time on trinity research but I have still made quite a few fixes to Q2. John Cash has made many more (he is just finishing up the IPX coding, among other things).</p>
<p>I have been doing a lot of testing over a proxy that gives me a very bad ping (400 - 800), so I was able to find and fix two significant errors with the prediction code.</p>
<p>The reason why you get a jerk when running forward and firing rockets, blasters, or grenades is that the client side prediction code was blocking you on your own missiles.</p>
<p>The jerky behavior on plats was due to a subtle error in the prediction error interpolation. A prediction error was causing oscillations as long as your latency, instead of smoothing out over just 100 ms. The plats are now smooth as long as you aren't dropping packets, and other mispredictions are also handled much better.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of other things that will be fixed in an upcoming release, but this will definately be an executable worth grabbing.</p>
