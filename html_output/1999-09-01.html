        <p>I have been working on our memory footprint for the past couple days. There are two types of paging that occur:</p>
<p>One time only paging that eventually settles down after you have run around the entire level a few times. This can be a result of having lots of data around that isn't actively used during the game, or was only used at startup.</p>
<p>True capacity misses, where the game is actually touching more memory during play than you have available. This is usually due to there just being too many textures and models.</p>
<p>Loading a large map with full resolution, 32 bit textures and mipmaps consumes almost 40 megs of texture space. The default of picmip 1 and 16 bit textures reduces that to six or seven (not all images observe picmip) in theory, but some OpenGL implementations keep a 32 bit version of the texture around even if the card only uses 16 bit (I consider this inapropriate), so it may still be twelve or more megs just for the images.</p>
<p>I have been able to save a couple megs off of the true capacity requirements by not rolling through some larger buffers when not needed (not smp and not dedicated server), and several megs more of one-time data mostly by moving a lot of static tables to dynamic allocation.</p>
<p>I can probably save another meg of true capacity and I think three or four megs of initialization data. The big thing that I might be forced to do is go to a skeletal animation system. I would hate to do that at this late a point in the project, but it would save about two megs per player model in the game.</p>
<p>In the process of chasing down the static memory hogs, I finally got around to starting something I have needed to do for years: learn perl.</p>
<p>I was scanning through a linker map file looking for large gaps in addresses, thinking to myself "this is one of those things you can probably do in three lines of perl code". I have many and varied excuses for why I have never gotten around to it before, mostly involving the fact that I have C parsing code that lets me get what I need done with only minimal headache when I do force myself to do some text file grovelling.</p>
<p>I decided my excuses weren't good anymore, and went out to the bookstore and grabbed the llama book. Many of you would have been amused seeing me go through the</p>
<p>print "Hello, $name!"</p>
<p>tutorial code as I did the examples in the first couple chapters. :-)</p>
<p>I got my task done, so now I just need to force myself to write little perl programs whenever a need comes up, until I get fluent with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>save 2.5 megs by reworking shader allocation</li>
<li>save 1 meg by not double buffering backend if not smp</li>
<li>convert all tr. arrays into pointers</li>
<li>don't allocate as many snapshotentities when non dedicated</li>
<li>new shader option: deformvertex move</li>
<li>stackable deformvertex</li>
<li>reduced lightning damage by 10%</li>
<li>light emit from two sided surfaces</li>
<li>reduced starting machinegun ammo in teamplay to 50 from 100</li>
</ul>
