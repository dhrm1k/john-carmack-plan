        <p>I just read the Wired article about all the Doom spawn.</p>
<p>I was quoted as saying "like I'm supposed to be scared of Monolith", which is much more derogatory sounding than I would like.</p>
<p>I haven't followed Monolith's development, and I don't know any of their technical credentials, so I am not in any position to evaluate them.</p>
<p>The topic of "is microsoft going to crush you now that they are in the game biz", made me a bit sarcastic.</p>
<p>I honestly wish the best to everyone pursuing new engine development.</p>
