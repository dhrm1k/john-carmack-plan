        <p>I've been following the ferrari discussion on r.g.c.q, and here are a couple clarifications:</p>
<p>The final rounds will definately be one on one deathmatch over a LAN, probably double elimination.</p>
<p>The big question is how do we get the number of people who would like to take a shot at it down to a reasonable (64?) number of people for a proper tournement.</p>
<p>We don't know yet where the final rounds are going to be held, either.  E3? #Quakecon? A microsoft event? A totally specific event?</p>
<p>I know that whatever we come up with won't be 100% fair to our entire customer base, but it would be really unfortunate if some people got bitter over it.</p>
