        <p>An announcement:</p>
<p>We have hired Robert Duffy as a full time employee, starting in December.</p>
<p>He has been maintaining the level editor since the release of Q2, but a number of things have convinced me it is time to have a full time tool-guy at id.</p>
<p>The original QE4 editor was my very first ever Win32 program, and while Robert has done a good job of keeping it on life support through necessary extensions and evolutions, it really is past its designated lifespan.</p>
<p>I want to take a shot at making the level editor cross platform, so it can be used on linux and mac systems. I'm not exactly confident that it will work out, but I want to try.</p>
<p>Many of the content creation tasks seem to be fairly stabilized over the last several years, and our next product is going to be pretty content directed, so I can justify more engineering effort on writing better tools.</p>
<p>It is time for a re-think of the relationships between editor, utilities, and game. I am still an opponent of in-game editors, but I want to rearrange a lot of things so that some subsystems can be shared.</p>
<p>All of that added up to more than I was going to be able to do in the time left after the various research, graphics, and networking things I want to pursue.</p>
