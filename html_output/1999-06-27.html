        <p>For the past couple years when talking to chip makers about new 3D features, 3D texture maps would always come up, and I would have to mutter something like: "I think it is a good thing, but I can't give you a really awesome example of using it. 3D Noise functions. Stuff like that."</p>
<p>I have the awesome example now: Lighting.</p>
<p>Through the entire development of Q3, I have been wanting to do dynamic lighting of the world differently. Many of the efficiencies gained by Q3's new map format result in larger and larger lightmaps while it reduces polygon count. That meant that even small dynamic lights may force a lot of work to generate new lighting textures.</p>
<p>I had been wanting to find a way to trade off additional rendering passes for less CPU time.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of me outthinking myself.</p>
<p>I knew it would have to be something with projecting a light spot texture onto the world geometry, but I am keenly enough aware of the issues and limitations in projecting a 2D texture onto 3D geometry that my mind kept looking at worst case scenarios -- how do you project a continuous texture onto the inside of a dome with the proper intensities, and some situations with curves. I thought it would require some non-trivial per triangle analysis and operations, when I really just wanted something that could be done on a per-vertex level.</p>
<p>Recently, the 3D texture insight hit me.</p>
<p>Create a 3D texture of, say, 32<em>32</em>32 texels and fill it with your light attenuation function, bright point in the center, fading off to black at the edge. Set it to clamp mode, so any values beyond the edges stay black. Set up a texture coordinate generation matrix to position the light relative to your models. Its a simple translate and scale. Set up lighting calculation to only generate a value based on the relative angles, ignoring attenuation. Use the resulting modulated texture mapping as your "lightmap" to modulate another texture pass, or add to a previous lighting pass.</p>
<p>This has several important benefits:</p>
<p>It looks good (and identical) on both small and large polygons. Vertex based lighting needs an appalling amount of tessellation to avoid visibly triangulation artifacts. Even if you tessellate to the same sample density as your lightmap grid (hundreds of thousands per map), vertex lighting still looks worse, because it is a triangular instead of bilinear interpolation.</p>
<p>It can be done completely by upcoming lighting and texgen hardware, but is efficient in software implementations.</p>
<p>It can be shadowed by either stencil volume shadows or shadow buffer tests.</p>
<p>Post Q3A, I plan on doing a research engine that is fully dynamically lit and shadowed instead of using lightmaps.</p>
<p>Ok, but we don't have 3D textures in any hardware now, so this doesn't help me for Q3A.</p>
<p>I continued thinking along complex lines, like "Any planar slice of a spherical 3D texture will be a 2D circle, and the three triangle points can occupy any location on their respective rings".</p>
<p>It still looked like a big mess.</p>
<p>I got tired of thinking about it, and just started coding in some infrastructure to do extra lighting passes. I just made a gradient circle texture for the lighting, and generated the texture coordinates by just translating and scaling X and Y from the world coordinates.</p>
<p>I got it running, grabbed a rocket launcher, and fired down a hallway. It looked just fine. I was stunned. I had been thinking about complex ramifications of weird edge cases for the past year when all it took was a couple hours of programming and the simplest possible approach to make it work decent. Sigh. :-)</p>
<p>The only real addition required was a fading of the light contribution with Z distance from the surface. The downside to this hack is that while you get a nice ball of light moving over floors and ceilings, you only get a wash of light on walls. In hindsight, I can analyze this in the context of our games and say "Almost all movement and targeting takes place in the XY plane in a FPS, so accuracy along the Z axis is not necessary."</p>
<p>The somewhat more obvious change to dynamic lighting that wasn't related to the projection issue is that I have it currently set up as a postprocess pass, rather than an additive pass on the lightmap. Adding to the lightmap is more "right", but it really complicates the multitexture implementation, and on some surfaces, the lightmap is actually done after the base texture, so it couldn't be added to. The end result is that brighter areas are changed more by dlights than dark areas. I don't feel TOO bad about that, because its not like the dlight is much of a proper lighting simulation even in the best case...</p>
