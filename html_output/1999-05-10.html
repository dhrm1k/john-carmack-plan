        <p>A good day of work. I just finished a long test game with all three architectures, and everything looks solid.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, these are ready to go after making installers and such, but everyone else has an oportunity to find bugs while I sleep...</p>
<p>We won't hold up for minor gameplay issues, but if anyone turns up a repeatable crasher I will rebuild everything.</p>
<p>Barring problems, we should start rolling the releases out tonight.</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed crash case on fallback from an unsupported fullscreen</li>
<li>fixed overrun with very fast system connecting to a very lagged server</li>
<li>fixed bad Z_Free on sounds not found</li>
<li>fixed autoswitch with sync clients</li>
<li>fixed losing console field on positive histories</li>
<li>fixed demo recording and playback with new net code</li>
<li>handle signed bit fields in msg code</li>
<li>fixed playerstate event bit loss on encoding</li>
<li>fixed "bad clientnum on player entity"</li>
<li>reenabled corpses sinking into ground</li>
</ul>
