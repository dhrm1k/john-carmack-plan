        <p>Zoid commented that my last .plan update sounded like Fred Brooks "The Mythical Man-Month". He is certainly correct.</p>
<p>When I read TMMM two years ago, I was stunned by how true and relevent it was. I have something of a prejudice against older computer books - I think "If its more than a five years old, it can't be very relevent" (sure, thats not too rational, but what prejudice is?).</p>
<p>Then I go and read this book that is TWENTY YEARS old, that talks about experience gained IN THE SIXTIES, and I find it mirroring (and often crystalizing) my thoughts on development as my experiences have taught me.</p>
<p>It even got me fired up about documenting my work. For about a day :)</p>
<p>I had to fly out to CA for biz on thursday, so I decided to grab and re-read TMMM on the plane.</p>
<p>It was just as good the second time through, and two more years of development under my belt hasn't changed any of my opinions about the contents.</p>
<p>If you program (or even work around software development), you should read this book.</p>
