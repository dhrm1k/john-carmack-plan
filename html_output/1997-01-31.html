        <p>I went down to the ferrari dealership today with Ann and American with the intention of buying a new f355 as a "sensible" car (in contrast to my other twin turbo monstrosities).</p>
<p>There was an F40 sitting out front.</p>
<p>Umm.  Sensible car.  F40.  Sensible car.  F40.  Hmmmm.</p>
<p>American played the evil conscience and Ann played the good conscience.  For a while.  Then Ann got infected by the Dark Side.  :-) I bought the F40.</p>
<p>Ok, I now have too many ferraris.  I have a plan to fix that.  This hasn't gone through all the legal crap necessary yet, but it is my intention to give away my first ferrari as the grand prize of a Quake tournement.</p>
<p>Yes, I am serious.</p>
<p>DO NOT SEND ME ANY MAIL ABOUT THIS! When we have more to say about it, we will make a formal announcement.  This would be a good time to start a heated debate in the newsgroups about what the fairest tourney rules would be, though.</p>
<p>The specs:  </p>
<p>1987 328 GTS with turbocharged engine.
Feature in the january, 1994 issue of Turbo magazine.
Made 360 HP at the rear wheels on a chassis dyno.
New engine (I melted the first one...), new paint.
The interior could use a little work.</p>
<p>I plan to also include enough cash to cover tax and insurance. </p>
