        <p>We had to upgrade the crashtest machine to NT sp 5, because some people were attacking it with windows crashers. Those don't count.</p>
<p>Crashtest #3 from [iBO]QWhAX0R was a combination of two problems:</p>
<p>The symptom was disconnecting all clients with an illegible server message. This turned out to be caused by the fact that I was parsing strings out of my net buffers with a MSG_ReadChar() function, and I was checking for EOF as a negative one return value. I had to change this to a MSG_ReadByte() call, because -1 was showing up in the messages, which then caused a parse error because it wasn't really the end of the message.</p>
<p>The actual root of that issue was code like this:
[code]
{
    char buffer[MAX_STRING_CHARS];
    ...
    strncpy( buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1 );
    ...
}
[/code]</p>
<p>No buffer overruns are possible, but buffer is not forced to be zero terminated if on the stack. I'm pretty sure this was a result of copy-and-paste code where buffer used to be a static with a guaranteed zero, but it made me find several other places where similar things were happening.</p>
<p>I had started using a Q_strncpyz() function a while ago that guarantees a trailing zero and doesn't require the -1, but it turned out that between code I had written a long time ago, and code that either Cash or Brian had added, there were still a lot of normal strncpy calls around. A lot of them were wrong, too. Either missing the -1, or missing the dedicated 0 fill in.</p>
<p>Crashtest #4 from Jim Paris was a variation on the first part of #3.</p>
<p>Only one of these attacks so far has been a server crasher, but I have been giving the bounty for anything that immediately kicks all the players. I probably won't give it for attacks that only overflow some lagged clients, but I'll evaluate as they happen.</p>
<p>I am off to E3 now for a bunch of PR silliness, so if crashtest goes down, it won't be back up for a while...</p>
