        <p>PACKET FILTERING</p>
<p>QuakeWorld supports two types of filtering: IP packet filtering  and user id filtering.  Userid filtering is the most convenient way  to keep a specific person off of a server, but because anyone can  create as many accounts as they want, a malicious user could just  keep logging back in with a new account.  If their ip address is  banned, they won't be able to log on with any account from that  computer.  Unfortunately, most dialup accounts give a different ip  address for each connection, so you may be forced to ban an entire  subnet to keep a specific person off.</p>
<p>You can add or remove addresses from the filter list with:</p>
<p>addip <ip> removeip <ip></p>
<p>The ip address is specified in dot format, and any unspecified  digits will match any value, so you can specify an entire class  C network with "addip 192.246.40".</p>
<p>Removeip will only remove an address specified exactly the same way.  You cannot addip a subnet, then removeip a single host.</p>
<p>iplist Prints the current list of filters.</p>
<p>writeip Dumps "addip <ip>" commands to iplist.cfg so it can be execed at  a later date.  The filter lists are not saved and restored by  default, because I beleive it would cause too much confusion.</p>
<p>filterban &lt;0 or 1&gt;</p>
<p>If 1 (the default), then ip addresses matching the current list  will be prohibited from entering the game.  This is the default  setting.</p>
<p>If 0, then only addresses matching the list will be allowed.  This  lets you easily set up a private game, or a game that only allows  players from your local network.</p>
