        <p>Wired magazine does something that almost no other print magazine we have dealt with does.</p>
<p>They check the statements they are going to print.</p>
<p>I just got a "fact check" questionaire email from wired about an upcoming article, and I recall that they did this last time the did an article about us.</p>
<p>Most of the time when we talk with the press, we try to get them to send us a proof of the article for fact checking. They usually roll their eyes, and grudgingly agree, then don't send us anything, or send it to us after it has gone to press.</p>
<p>Wired had a few errors in their statements, but it won't get printed that way because they checked with us.</p>
<p>How refreshing.</p>

<p>A small public announcement:</p>

<ol>
<li>People that develop games or game servers in <em>nix, and 2. People interested in learning how to develop games in </em>nix.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either one should give a write to ddt@crack.com.</p>
