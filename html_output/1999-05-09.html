        <p>We would up making tweaks to both maps today, so the data didn't reach final form until a few hours ago.</p>
<p>I just finished making release candidates for all three architectures, but I already found a couple problems that need to be fixed.</p>
<p>If everything goes perfectly (ha), and I nail these problems immediately when I wake up, then we might make it out tonight, but it is looking a bit doubtful.</p>
<p>There are a few known issues that I decided NOT to hold the test up for:</p>
<p>The gauntlet is functioning correctly, but the visuals are wrong. The designed behavior is that when you hold down attack it will scan for a target and only punch forward when it hits. The visuals currently show it punching constantly.</p>
<p>Dynamic lighting is currently taking a really excessive amount of cpu time. If you are having performance problems in firefights, you may want to turn it off. The option is in the preferences, or you can just issue "r_dynamicLighting 0" at the console.</p>
<p>The powerup item sounds aren't global across the entire world since I went to the client side predicted items.</p>
<p>There are some cases when a weapon that was picked up with a predicted item and immediately fired doesn't make a muzzle flash.</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed fs_copyfiles after ospath split</li>
<li>fixed look-at-killer</li>
<li>changed railgun impact to plasma dish</li>
<li>convert connect packet to infostring</li>
<li>put footsteps back in...</li>
<li>r_drawsun 0 by default to avoid probs for now</li>
<li>fixed event clear overwrite problem</li>
<li>client side predict weapon switch on item pickup</li>
<li>changed sound fallbacks to "visor" from "male"</li>
<li>made turbulent texcoords based off of xyz instead of st</li>
</ul>
