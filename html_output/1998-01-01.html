        <p>Some of the things I have changed recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed the cinematics</li>
<li>don't clear config after dedicated server</li>
<li>don't reallocate sockets unless needed</li>
<li>don't process channel packets while connecting</li>
<li>rate variable for modem bandwidth choking</li>
<li>delta compress client usercmds</li>
<li>fixed sound quality changing after intermissions</li>
<li>fixed PVS problem when head was directly under solid in GL</li>
<li>added r_drawflat and cl_testlights to cheats</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few problems that I am still trying to track down:</p>
<p>WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL errors
Map versions differ error
Sometimes connecting and seeing messages but not getting in
Decompression read overrun.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't actually get any of those errors on any of our systems here, so I am having to work remotely with other users to try and fix them, which is a bit tougher.</p>
<p>My new years resolution is to improve my coding style by bracing all single line statements and consistantly using following caps on multi word variable names.</p>
<p>Actually, I am currently trying on the full sun coding style, but I'm not so sure about some of the comment conventions: don't use multiple lines of // comments, and don't use rows of seperating characters in comments. I'm not convinced those are good guidelines.</p>
