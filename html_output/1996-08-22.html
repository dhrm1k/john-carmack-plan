        <p>The rendition 3d accelerated version of Quake looks very good.</p>
<p>The image quality is significantly better than software - dithered, bilinear interpolated textures, and subpixel, subtexel polygon  models.</p>
<p>It is faster than software even at 320<em>200, and at 512</em>384 it is  almost twice as fast.</p>
<p>We do take a bit of a hit when we have to generate a lot of 16 bit  surfaces, so occasionally the framerate gets a bit uneven, but  overall it is a very solid improvement.</p>
