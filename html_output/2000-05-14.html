        <p>I stayed a couple days after E3 to attend the SORAC amateur rocket launch. I have provided some sponsorship to two of the teams competing for the CATS (Cheap Access to Space) rocketry prize, and it was a nice opportunity to get out and meet some of the people.</p>
<p>It is interesting how similar the activity is around an experimental rocket launch, going to a race track with an experimental car, and putting out a beta version of new software is. Lots of "twenty more minutes!", and lots of well-wishers waiting around while the people on the critical path sweat over what they are doing.</p>
<p>Mere minutes before we absolutely, positively needed to leave to catch our plane flight, they started the countdown. The rocket launched impressively, but broke apart at a relatively low altitude. Ouch. It was a hybrid, so there wasn't really an explosion, but watching the debris rain down wasn't very heartening. Times like that, I definitely appreciate working in software. "Run it again, with a breakpoint!"</p>
<p>Note to self: pasty-skinned programmers ought not stand out in the Mojave desert for multiple hours.</p>
